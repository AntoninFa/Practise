you can use chocolatey to install ghci/haskell plattform for haskell on windows
"	
choco install haskell-dev	
refreshenv
"
should do that after installing Chocolatey https://www.haskell.org/platform/

after that you can type 
ghci
into your console to activate the Haskell Plattform, there you should already be able to use functionality like 
typing functions e.g. 4*4
to load a .hs program simply type:
:l program.hs
( provided you are in the correct subfolder i.e.: cd C:\Users\Antonin\Documents\GitHub\Practise\Haskell\basics
if not you have to write
:l FULLPATH\program.hs)
now you can use functions defined in program.hs, say there is f x = sin x/x defined in program.hs, you can input a 
value to f by writing:
f 10
output: -5.440211108893698e-2
f 3 
output: 4.70400026866224e-2

Other usefull commands:
:r 
to recompile your loaded file(after you changed something

:cd 
to change directory see cd in normal cmd (:dir sadly does not work)

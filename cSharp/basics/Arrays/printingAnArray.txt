static void Print1(string[] toPrint)
{
    foreach(string s in toPrint)
    {
        Console.Write(s);
    }
}

static void Print2(string[] toPrint)
{
    toPrint.ToList().ForEach(Console.Write);
}

// Am schnellsten, weil Syscall overhead nur einmal
static void Print3(string[] toPrint)
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join("", toPrint));
}

// Relativ clean noch
static void Print4(string[] toPrint)
{
    Array.ForEach(toPrint, Console.Write);
}

The results are as follows:

 Strings per trial: 10000
 Number of Trials: 100
 Total Time Taken to complete: 00:01:20.5004836
 Print1 Average: 484.37ms
 Print2 Average: 246.29ms
 Print3 Average: 70.57ms
 Print4 Average: 233.81ms

So Print3 is the fastest, because it only has one call to the Console.WriteLine which seems to be the main bottleneck for the speed of printing out an array. Print4 is slightly faster than Print2 and Print1 is the slowest of them all.

I think that Print4 is probably the most versatile of the 4 I tested, even though Print3 is faster.
